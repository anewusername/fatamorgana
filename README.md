# fatamorgana 

**fatamorgana** is a Python package for reading and writing OASIS format layout files.


**Capabilities:**
* This package is a work-in-progress and is largely untested -- it works for
    the tasks I usually use it for, but I can't guarantee I've even 
    tried the features you happen to use! Use at your own risk!
* Interfaces and datastructures are subject to change!
* That said the following work for me:
    - polygons
    - layer info
    - cell names
    - compressed blocks
    - basic property I/O


## Installation

**Dependencies:**
* python 3.5 or newer
* (optional) numpy


Install with pip from PyPi:
```bash
pip install fatamorgana
